POST /fetch-channel-videos
Fetches videos from a hardcoded list of YouTube channel URLs.
Saves all video URLs into the videos table, regardless of whether they already exist.
Use this to initially populate the database.
Example response:
{
    "status": "success",
    "channels_processed": 2,
    "videos_added": 4395
}

---------------------------------
POST /scan-new-channel-videos
Checks the same YouTube channels and inserts only new videos (i.e., not already in the videos table).
Use this to update the database regularly without duplicating entries.
Example response:
{
    "status": "success",
    "new_videos": 9
}

---------------------------------
POST /generate-tweets
Generates a tweet from the transcript of a video. Only generates a tweet if the first row in the 'videos' table
has status 'pending'. If the first row is already pending, it wonâ€™t generate another tweet. Waits until
the current pending video is published before generating the next one.

---------------------------------
POST /post-to-x
Posts the first video that has status 'pending' and a non-empty tweet_text field.
Skips any videos with status 'published' or with an empty tweet_text.
If no such video is found, nothing is posted.
